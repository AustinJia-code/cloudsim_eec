This is the repository for the Cloud Simulator project for CS 378. To run this project, you can compile the Scheduler with make scheduler and run make simulator to create your simulator executable. Run ./simulator Input.md to see your results.

For questions, please reach out to any of the course staff on via email (anish.palakurthi@utexas.edu, tarun.mohan@utexas.edu, mootaz@austin.utexas.edu) or Ed Discussion.

make scheduler; make simulator; ./simulator Input.md

Notes:
Decreasing active_machines ceteris paribus causes total energy and SLA0 to increase
What is "Number of machines" in input? Modifying it seems dangerous
